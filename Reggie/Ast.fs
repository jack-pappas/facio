(* TODO :   Add annotations for position information (i.e., position in the lexer
            definition file) to:
            -   CodeFragment
            -   Most cases in the Pattern type; some cases, like Epsilon and Empty,
                can't be explicity used in a lexer definition file so they don't have
                source positions.
            
            Create new type aliases 'MacroIdentifierWithPosition' and 'RuleIdentifierWithPosition',
            defined as (MacroIdentifier * SourcePosition) and (RuleIdentifier * SourcePosition),
            respectively. Modify the Specification record type to use these new aliases instead of
            MacroIdentifier and RuleIdentifier -- this allows us to keep position information for
            these identifiers (for emitting warnings/errors), but without actually making it part
            of the identifier type.

            We do NOT need to add a position annotation to RuleClause as previously thought,
            because the position information will already be containing within the Pattern instance. *)
